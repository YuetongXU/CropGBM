# Welcome to CropGBMÔºÅ

Crop Genomic Breeding machine (CropGBM) is a multifunctional program that integrates data preprocessing, population structure analysis, SNP selection, phenotype prediction, and data visualization. Has the following advantages:

* Use LightGBM algorithm to quickly and accurately predict phenotype values and support GPU-accelerated training.
* Supports selection and visualization of SNPs that are strongly related to phenotype.
* Support PCA and t-SNE two dimensionality reduction algorithms to extract SNP information.
* Support Kmeans and OPTICS two clustering algorithms to analyze the sample population structure.
* Plot histograms of heterozygosity rate, deletion rate, and frequency of alleles for genotype data.
